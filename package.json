As a result, nearly 12,000 individuals die every day due to a lack of availability of blood. The lack of knowledge and awareness about blood transfusion in many parts of the globe is a significant contributor to this problem. In January 2022, the American Red Cross declared its first-ever national blood crisis due to a severe blood shortage resulting from complications of the COVID-19 pandemic, which further emphasizes the urgent need to address this issue.",
